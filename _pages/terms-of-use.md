### Arbitration Rules.  

Arbitration shall be initiated through the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), an established alternative dispute resolution provider ("ADR Provider") that offers arbitration as set forth in this section. If AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Provider. The rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of this arbitration, including but not Limited to the method of initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except to the extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms.  The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules governing the arbitration are available online at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator.

### Severability.  

If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.

Notwithstanding any other clause contained in this Agreement or the AAA Rules, as defined below, any claim that all or part of this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator.

Driver agrees and acknowledges that entering into this arbitration agreement does not change Driver's status as an  independent contractor in fact or in law, that Driver is not an employee of Community Carpool and that any disputes in this regard shall be subject to arbitration as provided herein.

Any arbitration shall be governed by the American Arbitration Association Commercial Arbitration Rules ("AAA Rules"), except as follows:

The arbitration shall be heard by one Arbitrator selected in accordance with the AAA Rules. The Arbitrator shall be an attorney or retired judge with experience in the law underlying the dispute.

If the Parties cannot otherwise agree on a location for the arbitration, the arbitration shall take place in the county in which Driver provided Rides under the Terms and these Driver Terms.

Unless applicable Law provides otherwise, as determined by the Arbitrator, the Parties agree that Community Carpool shall pay all of the Arbitrator's fees and costs.

The Arbitrator may issue orders (including subpoenas to third parties) allowing the Parties to conduct discovery sufficient to allow each Party to prepare that Party's claims and/or defenses, taking into consideration that arbitration is designed to be a speedy and efficient method for resolving disputes.

Except as provided in the Class Action Waiver, the Arbitrator may award all remedies to which a Party is entitled under applicable law and which would otherwise be available in a court of law, but shall not be empowered to award any remedies that would not have been available in a court of law for the claims presented in arbitration. The Arbitrator shall apply the state or federal substantive law, or both, as is applicable.

Regardless of any other provision in the Terms or these Driver Terms, claims may be brought before and remedies awarded by an administrative agency if applicable law permits access to such an agency notwithstanding the existence of an agreement to arbitrate.

The AAA Rules may be found at www.adr.org or by searching for "AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules" using a service such as www.Google.org or www.Bing.org. Driver may also request a copy directly from Community Carpool.
