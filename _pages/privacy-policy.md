### CHILDREN

The Application, Site and Services are not directed to children and children are not eligible to use our Sites and Services. Protecting the privacy of children is very important to us. In connection with your use of the Services, you may have the option to provide us with certain Personal Information, such as a phone number and/or photograph. In the event that such Rider is under 13 years of age, by providing such information you affirm that you are such child's parent or guardian and have all requisite authority to provide us with such information and to authorize us to use such information. You also acknowledge that we will pass such information on to the Drivers who provide your Rides. Drivers will have access to a masked Community Carpool-provided phone number to allow the Driver to communicate with such Riders, including Riders who are children (however, the Rider's actual phone number, if you choose to provide it, will be masked and will not be provided directly to the Driver), the Rider's full name, the Rider's photo, if you choose to provide it, as well as information regarding such Account Passenger's schedule (if it is the case) (e.g." the activities that the Account Passenger is engaged in immediately prior to or after the Ride). If you choose to provide your Rider's phone number, Drivers will be able to communicate directly with Riders, including children under the age of 13, over the course of providing a Ride, via voice call and/or text message (through a masked phone number and not the Rider's actual phone number), as well as through in-person communication, In general, our Services are designed for parents, guardians, and other legally authorized adults, and only parents, guardians and such other legally authorized adults should use our Services.
USE OF INFORMATION
INFORMATION COLLECTED

## Personal Information

In general, the Personal Information we gather enables us to provide the Services to you. We require certain Personal Information when you register with us, including billing or payment related information so we can process transactions and other information to determine your eligibility to be a Driver, though some of this information may be transmitted directly to our payment processor or other third party service provider, We also collect Personal Information from you when you make or accept requests for Rides and otherwise use our Services. When you send an email or other communicate with Community Carpool, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our Services.

When you download the Application, we may collect your device type, your wireless carrier, and a device IP and we associate this with your Personal Information, though we primarily use this information to support your account and provide you with Services.

In addition, location-based information is collected through the Application, including, but not limited to geographic areas and other traffic and transportation-related data. If you are a Driver, the Application will enable us to collect your GPS coordinates during a Ride. Most GPS enabled mobile devices can define one's location to within 50 feet. This information will be also associated with the applicable Arranger for any specific Ride. You can choose not to provide us with certain information by disabling this functionality, but this may limit the features of the Application or Services you are able to use. For example, Drivers cannot provide Rides with this functionality disabled. We collect this information for various purposes - including improving and enhancing our Services and for our internal business purposes.

If you participate in a contest or giveaway with us, we may ask you for your e-mail address and/or home number (to notify you if you win or not). We may also ask for first and last names, and sometimes post office addresses to verify your identity. In some situations we may need additional information as a part of the entry process, such as a prize selection choice. These contests are voluntary. We recommend that you read the rules for each contest that you enter. If you provide us feedback or contact us via e-mail, we will collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any other content included in the e-mail in order to send you a reply.

To the extent you post Personal Information in comments in a publicly available area of our Services (e.g., feedback and reviews), it will be available to other users of the Services who may use it at their discretion. Please be thoughtful about the information that you post in any forums or comments.


## How we gather and use cookies and other anonymous information.

Information Collected by Our Servers.  To make our Application and Services more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) collect information from you, including your browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol “IP”) address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. which may vary from session to session), domain name, and/or a date/time stamp for your visit.

### Log Files.  

As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files, This information includes IP addresses, browser type, Internet service provider ("ISP"), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data, We use this information to analyze trends, administer the Services, track users' movements around the Services, gather demographic information about our user base as a whole, and better tailor our Services to our users' needs, For example, some of the information may be collected so that when you visit the Application or the Services again, it will recognize you and the information could then be used to serve advertisements and other information appropriate to your interests.

### Cookies.  

Like many online services, we use cookies to collect information. "Cookies" are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer's hard drive while you are viewing the website.  We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience within our Services. This type of information is collected to make the Services more useful to you and to tailor the experience with us to meet your special interests and needs. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to accept cookies from our Services for any of the purposes described above, then you can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. Consult your browser's technical information. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Services or all functionality of the Services.

### Pixel Tags.  

In addition, we use "Pixel Tags" (also referred to as clear Gifs, Web beacons, or Web bugs). Pixel Tags are tiny graphic images with a unique identifier similar in function to Cookies, that are used to track online movements of Web users. In contrast to Cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, Pixel Tags are embedded invisibly in Web pages. Pixel Tags also allow us to send e-mail messages in a format users can read, and they tell us whether e-mails have been opened to ensure that we are sending only messages that are of interest to our users. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to a user. We do not tie the information gathered by Pixel Tags to our users' Personal Information.

### Collection of Information by Advertisers.  

We may use third parties to serve ads on the Services. Certain third parties may automatically collect information about your visits to this and other websites, your IP address, your ISP, the browser you use to visit our Services (but not your name, address, e-mail address or telephone number). They do this by using Cookies or other technologies. Information collected may be used, among other things, to deliver advertising targeted to your interests and to better understand the usage and visitation of our Services and the other sites tracked by these third parties. This policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, Cookies or pixel tags in third party ads, and we encourage you to check the privacy policies of advertisers and/or ad services to learn about their use of Cookies and other technologies. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click here: http://www.aboutads.info/choices (http://www.aboutads.info/choices).

### Mobile Services.  

We may also collect non-personal information from your mobile device if you have downloaded our Application to your mobile device. This information is generally used to help us deliver the most relevant information to you. Examples of information that may be collected and used include your geographic location, how you use our mobile service(s) and information about the type of device you use.  This information is sent to us as aggregated information and is not traceable to any individual and cannot be used to identify an individual.

Disclosure - Analytics. We may also use third party tracking services to help us analyze how users use the Application and Services. These services collect only the unique device identifier assigned to your mobile device, rather than your name or other personally identifying information, and use it to collect information such as how often users open the Application and what features they use in the Application. Only these services know and associate you (on a non-identifiable basis) with your identifier. For example, Google Analytics collects only the I P address assigned to you on the date you visit the Services, rather than your name or other personally identifying information. Although Google Analytics plants a persistent Cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit the Services, the Cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google's ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Services is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy.
