### Driver Background Check
Includes criminal background check, drug screening, and fingerprinting as allowed by law. Our drivers must be legally able to work in the US. We verify residence within the local community and that the driver holds a valid driver's license with a clean record for the past 5 years. [More details.]({{site.baseurl}}/background-check-detail)

### Verified Driver Assessment

Every driver must undergo a personal interview and provide references. Drivers must prove that the vehicle they drive is either owned or lease by them, is not more than 8 years old, and has 4 doors. No passengers are permitted to sit in the front seat.

### Driving Record Confirmation

Our drivers must be over 25 years of age and have maintained a clean driving record for at least the past 5 years.

### Required Vehicle Inspection

We run a complete motor vehicle records check on every driver and a comprehensive [19-point vehicle safety inspection]({{site.baseurl}}/vehicle-inspection-detail/).

### Mandatory Vehicle Insurance

We mandate that driver insurance meets or exceeds state requirements, in addition to Community Carpool's company-supplied insurance coverage.

### Strict Driving Policy

All Drivers are required to complete our online tutorial and abide by our zero tolerance code with regard to no alcohol, drugs, smoking, use of electronics, or animals in the vehicle while driving.

### Cashless Transactions

Keep a debit / credit card on file for cashless transactions.

### Viewable Driver Pictures and Profiles

All drivers post a brief profile for the exclusive viewing of Community Carpool members. Get to know your neighbors, and through the Community Bulletin Board develop connections based on the shared interests of your child with other children in the community.

### Password Protected Pickup + Deliveries

Through the Community Carpool app, you set the password that only your child and the child's driver will share.

### Real-Time Tracking of Rides

Our proprietary software enables you to track and see your child's ride in real time with notification of pickup and drop-off, so you can be assured your child is safe.
