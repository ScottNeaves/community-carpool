              <h3>Jacob Sack</h3>
              <p>Jacob is a Director at Oxeon Partners, a Healthcare Growth Services firm committed to Making People Healthier. He works with entrepreneurs and more established businesses in the Healthcare IT and Services sector to improve individual and community health. Before joining Oxeon, Jacob worked at the Edna McConnell Clark Foundation (EMCF) – a social venture investment firm – as a Senior Portfolio Associate. Jacob caught the social venture bug during his prior experience as a program and business development manager at Public/Private Ventures, a policy and research organization committed to understanding what works (and what doesn’t!) to improve the lives of the most vulnerable young people and families.</p>
              <p>When he’s not in the office, or working at odd hours with his Community Carpool co-founder, you’re likely to find Jacob running through NYC. He was deeply inspired by Christopher McDougall’s “Born to Run” – or traveling to be with friends and family. Sack earned a bachelor’s degree in government and legal studies from Bowdoin College and his Master’s in Education Entrepreneurship in a joint School of Education/Wharton program at Penn.</p>
