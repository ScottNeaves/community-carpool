# Background Checks
{:.text-primary .text-center}

---------------------

#### Community Carpool completes three types of background checks on each driver before they are admitted to drive as a member of Community Carpool.

### I. Basic Background Check
A Basic Background Check searches names based on the provided social security number against select databases sourced from various jurisdictions which are then verified against available county court records and sex offender registries. In most instances, around seven years of records data is returned except where limited by the jurisdiction or law. The Basic Background Check does not include federal records or a manual search of county records where the person has lived or worked. Click here to see what is included.

### II. Enhanced Background Check
An Enhanced Background Check includes all elements of a Basic Background Check plus a search of the name provided and up to one alias/maiden name in all counties associated with the provided social security number over the last seven years (as determined by a social security number trace). In most instances, around seven years of records data is returned except where limited by the jurisdiction or law. The Enhanced Background Check does not include federal records.

### III. Motor Vehicle Records Checks
A Motor Vehicle Records Check includes a search of the state’s motor vehicle records database based on the driver’s license and state provided. Information reported varies by state, and records in other states may not be included in the search of a state’s motor vehicles records database. In most instances, no more than seven years of records data is returned. If a Motor Vehicle Records Check returns any results, a badge will not appear on the profile. If the results of a Motor Vehicle Records Check show any of the offenses below, the individual will be removed from the website:

- Any charge that states it is a felony or misdemeanor
- Driving under the influence (DUI); driving while intoxicated (DWI); operating under the influence (OWI); operating/driving - While impaired; drug related offense; failure to submit to a sobriety test;
- Violence related offense; vehicular assault; homicide, manslaughter, or vehicular homicide
- Driving while drivers license is expired, suspended, or revoked; driving without a drivers license;
- Allowing unlicensed driver to operate vehicle;
- Drag racing; reckless driving;
- Reckless driving; careless driving; negligent driving; racing;
- Hit and run; leave the scene of an accident; fail to report accident;
- Evading/fleeing a police officer;
- Fail to pay fines/fail to appear in court;
- Child restraint violation; and
- Habitual offender

 It is important to remember that background checks are not foolproof; criminals may circumvent even the most sophisticated search technology; and background checks may give a false sense of security and are not the perfect safety solution.
